Sherry is a PhD student in the Tri-Institutional Program in Computational
Biology & Medicine Program. She completed her bachelor's degree at MIT,
majoring in computer science & molecular biology, as well as minoring in
management and German. As an undergraduate student researcher, Sherry studied
post-transcriptional gene regulation, including RNA secondary structures and
metabolism in SARS-CoV-2 at the Whitehead Institute. She also pursued a project within
the MIT Bioengineering Department on optimizing a DNA data storage system. In her free
time, Sherry reads (realistic fiction 📚), writes (doodles in her diary ✍🏼), watches
TV/movies (always open to more recommendations! 🎬), and enjoys the ease of getting
around NYC to explore everything the city has to offer (Broadway, NYPL, and
discovering lovely new hangouts with friends 🍜). Sherry is currently co-advised 
by the Lareau Lab and the Victoria Lab at Rockefeller University.
