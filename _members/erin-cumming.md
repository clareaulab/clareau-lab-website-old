Erin Cumming is a Research Fellow in the Lareau Lab at MSK. Hailing from Scotland,
she completed her bachelor’s degree in Molecular Genetics at the University of Dundee,
with a brief period spent working at Charles River, where she engaged in in vitro
toxicology assay development. During her Ph.D. in Cancer Research and Precision Oncology
from the CRUK Scotland Institute (formerly Beatson Institute for Cancer Research,
University of Glasgow), she investigated the role of the sialoglycoprotein Podocalyxin
in colorectal cancer before transitioning to another lab within the same institute for
a short post-doc focusing on GSK3β treatment resistance in pancreatic cancer.
Beyond science, Erin finds comfort in the great outdoors. While still exploring
her varied interests, she harbors a keen enthusiasm for new experiences and is
constantly seeking to broaden her view of the world 🌎!
