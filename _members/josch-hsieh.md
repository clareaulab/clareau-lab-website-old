Yu-Hsin (Josch) was an exchange PhD student in the Lareau Lab.
At his home institute, [Leif Ludwig Lab](https://www.mdc-berlin.de/ludwig)
in the Berlin Institute of Health, he is involved in collaborative work with 
Caleb to investigate the immune landscape of patients with mitochondrial disease 
via single-cell multi-omics approaches. As a Taiwan native, he is on a personal 
mission to find the best Asian foods in the city 🍱🍜🍲. When he's not in the lab
or satisfying his taste buds, you can spot Josch strolling on the street and enjoying
the beautiful NYC skyline 🌉🌇.
