<b>Transcript-specific enrichment enables profiling of rare cell states via single-cell RNA sequencing</b>

Single-cell genomics technologies have accelerated our understanding of cell-state heterogeneity in nearly every complex tissue.
While single-cell genomics can identify rare populations that express specific marker transcript combinations,
traditional flow sorting requires cell surface markers with high-fidelity antibodies,
limiting followup study, particularly when nuclei isolation is required. 
Programmable Enrichment via RNA Flow-FISH by sequencing (PERFF-seq) is our solution to these challenges
by enabling scRNA-seq profiling of subpopulations defined by the abundance of specific RNA transcripts.

Here's a hub for the key links associated with PERFF-seq.
