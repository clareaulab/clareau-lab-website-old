Our lab is an advocate for open and reproducible science. This includes both 
experimental details to generate data and line-by-line computational workflows
to reproduce critical insights. As many of our own insights come from reanalyzing
data from previously published work, 
we take special care to ensure that resources from our works are available
in easy-to-access formats.
