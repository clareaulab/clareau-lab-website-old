Our lab is an advocate for reproducible science, both experimentally and computationally. 
We take special care to ensure that critical resources from our major efforts are available
in easy-to-access formats for future users. These include custom code for downstream analyses,
new software for processing large datasets, 
novel sequencing data generated as part of our profiles, and experimental protocols for trying
these out yourself. 


Check out these resources for code, protocols, and data:
