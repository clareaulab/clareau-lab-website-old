title: Critically acclaimed Halloween costume :D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

At the Annual MSK IGO open house, [our crew dressed up as Rick and Morty's (and portals).](https://x.com/CalebLareau/status/1852019342650617930)
We were voted the funniest group costume--that means a [free  &nbsp; :pizza:  &nbsp; party](https://www.reddit.com/r/rickandmorty/comments/22iese/one_large_person_with_extra_people_please/)! 
Thanks IGO!!
