title: New preprint on synonymous mtDNA variation
---

A new preprint outlining a potential role for synonymous variation in the mitochondrial 
genome just dropped on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.23.537997v1)!
In brief, we provide new lines of evidence that synonymous variation in the mitochondrial genome
may have a functional role due ot the limited tRNA pool requiring wobble-dependent translation.
