# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-flask" %}Computational and Translational Immunology

The overall theme of our lab's research is **Computational and Translational Immunology**,
which 

Our laboratory has broad interests in studying processes of [somatic evolution](somatic-evolution) whereby cells
adapt, expand, differentiate, or die in response to genetic and environmental factors within 
an individual's lifetime. We're particularly interested in studying these processes in the hematopoetic 
system, spanning circulating blood to immune cells that are resident in tissues and tumors.
