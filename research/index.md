# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-flask" %} Lareau Lab Research

The focus of the Lareau Lab is to understand how cells in our bodies adapt, expand, and
evolve during the course of our lives, particularly in the immune system.
We are particularly interested in how somatic evolution—the collection of mutations,
infections, and exposures to therapies that humans experience over a lifetime—reshapes
these fundamental cellular processes. For example, we're interested in how hematopoietic 
and immune cells change.

To study these processes, our group develops and applies computational methods
and genomics-based technologies. 
We specialize in utilizing single-cell multi-omics approaches that profile multiple
orthogonal properties of the same individual cells, including cell state and lineage.
In addition to resolving the functional heterogeneity of cells throughout the body,
we hope to help translate our basic observations into safer and more efficacious cancer immunotherapies. 

The overall theme of our lab's research is **Computational and Translational Immunology**,
which 

Our laboratory has broad interests in studying processes of [somatic evolution](somatic-evolution) whereby cells
adapt, expand, differentiate, or die in response to genetic and environmental factors within 
an individual's lifetime. We're particularly interested in studying these processes in the hematopoetic 
system, spanning circulating blood to immune cells that are resident in tissues and tumors.
