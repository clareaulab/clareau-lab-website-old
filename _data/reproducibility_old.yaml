  title: <b>Viral reactivation uncovered in existing genomics datasets</b>
  authors: 
  - These resources provide an overview for mining existing human sequencing datasets for the presence of viral nucleic acids. We used this framework to discover the reactivation of HHV-6 during T cell culture, including in the manufacturing of therapeutic CAR T cells. Code and data for this work are outlined here.
