  title: <b>Programmable Enrichment via RNA FlowFISH by sequencing</b>
  authors: 
  - PERFF-seq is new technology for studying rare cell types via nucleic acid cytometry upstream of scRNA-seq. Our resources highlight code to reproduce downstream analyses of PERFF-seq data as well as step-by-step protocols for performing your own experiment.
