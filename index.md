# Welcome! 

Our lab will be launching from [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/) in New York, NY
in September 2023. 

We are a team of interdisciplinary scientists that specializes studying <b>computational and translational immunology</b>.
Specifically, our group develops and utilizes single-cell multi-omics technologies and
computational biology to uncover secrets of the human hematopoietic system, how immune cells change as we age,
and how we can co-opt principles of functional immunity to improve the safety and efficacy of 
immunotherapies.

The lab is currently recruiting at all levels. Come grow with us!
