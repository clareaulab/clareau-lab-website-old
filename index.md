# Welcome! 

Our lab is located in the Computational and Systems Biology program at
[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/) in New York, NY. 

We are a team of interdisciplinary scientists that specializes in <b>computational and translational immunology</b>.
Specifically, our group develops and utilizes single-cell multi-omics technologies and
computational biology to study human hematopoietic system as how immune cells change as we age and 
are exposed to pathogens, including endemic viruses. 
We seek to leverage principles from genomics technologies to improve the safety and efficacy of 
immunotherapies.
