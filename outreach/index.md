The mission of our lab is to train the next generation of scientific leaders, 
particularly those with an interest in utilizing large-scale data 
When you are filling out application materials, mention the Lareau Lab 
as a group that you would like to work with and be sure to 
highlight the use of large datasets as part of your interest in future research projects. 

## Are you in high school and interested in a scientific career?

Our lab accepts high school students through the
[Weill Cornell High School Catalyst Program](https://diversity.weill.cornell.edu/opportunities/high-school-catalyst-program).
As part of this program, you will be granted a Weill Cornell ID with full access to our lab and resources.

## Are you an undergraduate looking for a summer research experience?

We participate in the [MSKCC Computational Biology Summer Program](https://www.mskcc.org/education-training/summer-scientific-undergraduate-programs/computational-biology-summer-program-cbsp)
to host undergraduate students in our research group during the summer. As part of this program, you will meet with Caleb weekly to develop and execute an independent project. 

## Are you looking for full-time employment as a post-bac?

Our lab partners with the [MSK Bridge Program](https://www.mskcc.org/education-training-programs/msk-bridge)

# Interested in making a difference? 

## Are you or someone you love under the age of 45?

One of the most effective ways to prevent more than six types of cancer is by
[getting the HPV vaccine](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/patient-education/preventing-hpv-related-cancers). 
If you or someone you love is younger than 45 (ideally aged 9-12), 
getting the vaccine will protect you against the 9 most common 
strains of HPV infection that can cause cancer. 
It is <b>safe, effective, and easy</b>. If you have questions about the vaccine
or if you should get it, [email Caleb](mailto:lareauc@mskcc.org) who can 
help answer any questions or help connect you to a doctor at MSKCC. 

## Are you interested in help raising funding for cancer research?

Our lab participates in [Cycle For Survival](https://www.cycleforsurvival.org), a nation-wide
movement to defeat rare cancers. Our lab both participates by raising funds and riding as 
well as being the recipients of generous donations world-wide. To support our cause, consider
[donating to the Lareau Lab team today](https://www.cycleforsurvival.org/donate/team-search?team_search=lareau).

Members of the Lareau Lab are part of in the [Fred's Team with the New York City Marathon](https://www.fredsteam.org/).
