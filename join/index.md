## Philosophy

Our mission as a lab is to train and develop the next generation of scientific leaders. 
Whether you see yourself continuing in academia, building your own startup, teaching, 
pursuing science policy, or are trying to figure it out, we will help you attain
the skills and expertise needed to excel in the next phase of your career. 

In this pursuit, we are committed to ensuring that the environment in the lab is inclusive of individuals
from diverse socio-economic, educational, and cultural backgrounds.

## Postdoctoral associates

We are recruiting 2-3 postdoctoral associates to help build the research environment in the lab.
We are particularly interested in individuals with wet-bench 
backgrounds, including those that seek mentored training in computational biology,
data science, genomics, and/or biotechnology. 

Postdocs will be employees of Memorial Sloan Kettering and be eligible for 
[all postdoc benefits](https://www.mskcc.org/education-training/postdoctoral/resources-postdocs/compensation-benefits-resources),
